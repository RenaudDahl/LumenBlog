# LumenBlog


**Project origin**

This project is a simple API designed to provide basic blog service : 
  - list of articles
  - display one article for the user to read
  - a back-office to create, update or delete articles.

The purpose of this was for me to get used to GitHub as well as testing the micro-framework Lumen. 
As a beginning Symfony2 developper it was interesting to experiment with this micro-framework for future small APIs, 
in which performance is extremely important.

You can see in my GitHub another similar project I did at the same time to try the micro-framework Silex, the point of these projects being the comparison of these mini-frameworks.


**Project result**

I actually decided to choose Lumen for future projects. 
The determining factor was the ease in coding, and the presence of an ORM and the provided architecture were the key arguments.  
Silex' advantages were the ease to add Symfony components like Form and Twig, but at this point it's almost better to go for Symfony itself (regardless of the performances). 

**Further features**

The features in this project that are different from the SilexBlog came after the final decision. After testing the API I wanted to test the template engine Blade, provided by Lumen, to do a fully-fonctionnal application.
The point here was mainly to get more familiar with Lumen to use it in the next weeks on professionnal projects.
